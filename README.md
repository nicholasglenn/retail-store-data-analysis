# Retail Store Data Analysis

Project Description:
In todayâ€™s digital era, retail businesses face growing challenges in understanding dynamic customer behavior. This project aimed to help a retail company extract valuable insights from their sales data to improve strategic decisions in marketing, pricing, and customer retention.

My Solution:
- I conducted an end-to-end analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Excel. The steps included:
- Identifying top-performing products contributing most to total sales
- Analyzing customer retention trends over time
- Tracking daily and monthly sales trends
- Measuring price elasticity to understand the effect of pricing on sales volume
- Performing basket size analysis to identify potential transaction value and cross-selling opportunities

Impact:
The analysis provided actionable insights that helped the business understand key sales drivers, optimize promotional strategies, and make informed pricing decisions. It also offered a clearer view of customer loyalty and purchase behavior patterns.
